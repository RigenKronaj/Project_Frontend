# Project_Frontend

The Frontend part of the final project of ASDEV.

The application currently has the capability to receieve data from the backend,
as well as filtered data should the user request it, and display it all in
a compact format.

For the sake of demonstration, the website currently displays dummy data for a
library that is read directly from the backend, written in Java.

ReactJS was used for the Frontend.

The goal is to introduce additional functionality, as well as ironing out minor flaws
by the end of the project deadline.
